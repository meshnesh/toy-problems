# in Python, data input is accomplished using one of the following statemenets
#
# #Read a string from the keyboard
# var_name_str = input([prompt]) #Read a string from the keyboard
# var_name_int = int(input([prompt]))
# #Read a real from the keyboard
# var_name_float = float(input([prompt]))



# name = input()
#
# age = int(input())
#
# print('You are ' , age , ' years old ', name, ' !')


# or


# name = input('What is your name?')
#
# age = input('What is your age?')
#
# print('You are ' , age , ' years old ', name, ' !')




# //


print("What is your name? ", end = "")
name = input()
print("What is your age? ", end = "")
age = int(input())
print("Wow, you are already", age, "years old,", name, "!")
